        <h3 id="toright">Java, JavaScript, React</h3>
        <p style="text-align: right;">I have gained a substantial amount of Java, JS and React knowledge through building projects such as: a crypto derivatives trading exchange and a parking system for Sioux.</p>

        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>One of my biggest achievements with Python was building a license plate detector and reader for the parking system for Sioux and implementing it with our Java back-end. I have also completed the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023"
and built many different Python projects during it. The Python libraries and technologies I've worked with include pandas, numpy, matlab, opencv, etc.</p>
